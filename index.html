                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello my name is Alex Canales.
                    I am a passionate Computer Science major at Texas Christian University that is an incoming sophmore, 
                    with a minor in Mathematics and Philosophy.
                    At Brownsburg, I fell in love with Computer Science taking classes like Computer Science Principles, 
                    Computer Science Applications, Digital Electronics, and Cybersecurity. 
                    Some other classes that I took in High School that I took that gave me a well-rounded preparation for 
                    college was Calculus BC and Physics Mechanics: C.
                    It was not until the end of my senior year of high school that I decided to take the opportunity given to me
                    at Texas Christian University to pursue higher education.
                </p>

                <h2>High School Accomplishments</h2>

                <p>
                    I graduated in 2022 at the top of my class, and wanted to persue Computer Science in College from the classes I 
                    took from High School. I was a part of <i><b>National Honors Society</b></i> with a cumulative GPA of 4.6 on a 4.0 scale. High 
                    School acitivies I was a part of was a tutoring program that my school ran. Some hobbies that I picked up in High School included 
                    skiing, fishing, and playing the guitar. I fell in love with these things and tried to stick with them as much as I could growing 
                    up, and continue them in college. I was involved with the wrestling team at my High School as well. My Junior year, we finished 
                    12th in the nation and I was proud to be a wrestler on that team.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Collegiate Accomplishments</h2>

                <p>
                    At Texas Christian University, I have completed two semesters. Within these two semesters, I was able to make it on 
                    the <i><b>Dean's Honors List for the TCU College of Science and Engineering</b></i> for both semesters of my Freshman Year. Along with 
                    this, I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA my second semester of my Freshman Year.
